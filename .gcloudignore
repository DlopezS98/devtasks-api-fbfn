# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

node_modules
# Don't include .gitignore since it excludes our built lib files
# Add specific exclusions instead:
src/
*.ts
*.map
tsconfig*.json
.vscode/
http/
README.md
.eslintrc.js
.prettierrc
nodemon.json
